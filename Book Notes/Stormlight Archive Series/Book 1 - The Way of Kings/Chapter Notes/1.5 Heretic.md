### Summary
Shallan finally meets Jasnah in person. They begin to walk and talk together as the king of Kharbranth, Taravangian, to whom Jasnah was speaking with before Shallan arrived, leads them down the hall urgently. His daughter has been trapped in a room behind a fallen rock, and Jasnah, upon arriving there, soulcasts the rock into smoke to remove it.

After further brief discussion, Jasnah says that she will not accept Shallan as her ward, and walks away. Shallan is frustrated, but her determination redoubles; she will not give up that easily. Her family's lives are at stake, and it's already taken her 6 months to get this far. She calms herself and heads down the same path that Jasnah went down just a moment before. Shallan is determined, she *will* save her family. And she will do so by stealing Jasnah's soulcaster.

* I like this quote: ```“Ignorance is hardly unusual, Miss Davar. The longer I live, the more I come to realize that it is the natural state of the human mind. There are many who will strive to defend its sanctity and then expect you to be impressed with their efforts.”```
