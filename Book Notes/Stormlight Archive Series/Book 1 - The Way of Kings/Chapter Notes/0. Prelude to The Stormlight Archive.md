### Summary
Kalak and Jezrien meet at an unknown meeting place, seemingly after a battle of one of the Desolations. Kalak has dreaded returning, as he knows it to mean a long torturous wait for some reason. 

Jezrien, the king of something, informs Kalak that the Oathpact will end now. The others are already gone, having left their swords (which are stronger than a shardblade) stuck in a ring of stone. Jezrien also informs Kalak that Talenel (aka Taln) had died in this battle, and thus would be left in the unnamed torturous location as the others leave Taln behind to suffer. 

"Better one man than ten" - Jezrien.

Jezrien plunges his sword into the stone and begins walking away. Kalak, filled with regret and sorrow for Taln, eventually does the same.

### Questions
* Who even are these people? It says they're regarded as divine by regular humans, and there's a group known as the Knights Radiant who are even below this group of 10 people.
* Why do they continually suffer? Where do they go to be tortured (maybe eternally?) regardless of whether they live or die in these battles?
* What is the Oathpact? it sounds important so it's probably something worth remembering exists at least
* What will eventually happen with Taln? How will his fate compare with the other divine folks who abandoned him?
