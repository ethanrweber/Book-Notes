### Summary
Lord Tresting is the lord of a plantation out in the country. He has slaves of Skaa people who work the land for him, and he gives the crops to the Lord Ruler. Ash falls from the sky constantly, and the lands are covered in a fearful mist at night. The Skaa slaves are dull and afraid, and they live every day in drudgery and fear...

until a Skaa with scars on his arms known as Kelsier, The Survivor, arrived through the mist one night. He possesses an unknown ability called Allomantic power which "surges through his body" and apparently lets him store (?) and *burn* tin metal inside his stomach? Well, he leaves the same night he arrives after hearing some screams, and the Skaa slaves don't see him again before he leaves the plantation. 

But in the morning they see the remains of Lord Tresting's mansion; it has burned to the ground, and Tresting and 20 or more soldiers of his are dead. Kelsier somehow defeated and killed them all. The now-free Skaa slaves, led by one named Tepper, resolve to head east to the caves in hopes that rebel skaa will take them in based on what they've heard from other travelers.
