### Summary
Eko is a young girl with 6 siblings. She lives in a small mountain village, free from the bureaucracy of the nearby kingdom as the village is so remote. Her family takes a trip to see a man who is stuck in a tree, who has been stuck in there for decades. When everyone else but Eko is asleep though, the man in the tree moves! He breaks free from the tree and falls to the ground. Eko tells the others, but he is gone by the time she returns with them. They of course believe her though because obviously he is no longer stuck to the tree. The father is a bit disappointed because coming here was something of a yearly ritual that will now end, and so they head back home.

As they return home, Eko catches the occasional glimpse of the tree boy following them. She leaves out some food and drink for him, and when next she checks, the food and drink is gone, so she assumes that it was in fact the tree boy who took it. Who could guess what such a "magical being" is up to?
