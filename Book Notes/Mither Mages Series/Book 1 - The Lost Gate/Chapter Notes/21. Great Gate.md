### Summary
Danny, Hermia, Veevee, Stone, the Silvermans, and Ced (the windmage) gather together to form a Great Gate. They deliberate for a while, but eventually they do it. Danny forms the Great Gate, and immediately feels the Gate Thief attempt to suck out his outself and all his remaining gates. He realizes though that he is much stronger than the Gate Thief and the sum total of all the outselves that the Gate Thief has already stolen, and recalls the runic passage from chapter [[6. Fistalk]]. He pulls on the Gate Thief's outself and all the others that have been collected. When the Gate Thief attempts to fight back, Danny clamps down, separating them all from the Gate Thief and pulling them into himself. He is met with thousands of voices in his head that he can't (yet (hopefully)) control, and falls to the floor, screaming.
