### Summary
Eric saw Danny appear through a gate. He immediately accepts it, and asks for more info - and threatens to report him to the police / the government otherwise. That idea is immediately dismissed as idiotic (because no one would believe him), but Danny gives in anyway and tells Eric what's up. They talk about robbing rich people and stuff.

A small group of security guards comes up and demands they empty their pockets. Eric and Danny do so, and in addition, take off their clothes and moon the guards. Then they go to a "fence" - a person who knowingly buys stolen goods to resell for a profit. They argue with him over what he would buy, and he tells them to get out of his store in case they're cops or with the cops.

They go to Stone's house, a townhouse in a decent-enough neighborhood where Ced and Lana are staying. They walk in. Ced is rolling up a joint and Lana attempts to molest Danny. He goes to bed in the attic.

He wakes up and has to pee, so he gates to the bathroom and back. Somehow, Stone himself is in the attic though when he returns. "Your secret is safer with me than with Eric." Then Stone left the room.

Danny heads downstairs in the morning to find Eric and Stone. Stone gives him some advice to ditch Eric.

### Questions
* Was Stone in that chair in the attic the whole time? Otherwise, how did he get there without (seemingly) making noise?
