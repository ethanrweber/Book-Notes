### Summary
While out for a run one day, a middle-aged woman named Victoria Von Roth appears in front of Danny. She traveled through one of his gates (that he doesn't have the ability to close (yet)), and he ran into her. Turns out she's a keyfriend, or some other type of gateless gatemage. She's cunning and witty just like Danny, but has a bit of a charm about her.

She also knows Leslie and Marion Silverman already. Danny shows her to the house, and they all meet with each other. They basically tell her that she's free to help Danny with studying gatemagery, but she's not welcome at their home - they had a falling-out in the past.
