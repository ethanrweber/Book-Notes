### Summary
The Greek girl actually manages to catch up with Danny. Turns out she's more than a Finder. She can actually pass through gates and other things, which unfortunately means that her family is contractually bound to having her killed; so she's been on the run.

She was the one closing his gate at the rope climb last chapter. It turns out that by *twisting* the gate as he was doing, he was actually creating a Great Gate!

She pleads with him to help her. She can't make gates herself, and her family will likely pour more resources into finding her than his will to find him, and she is therefore much more likely to be caught. But she can be of use to him if / when he does attempt to make a real Great Gate.


### Details
* Gatemages don't have normal outselves, they have *hearthoards*. Which is to say that their outself is fractured into thousands, if not millions, of "grains" which can be formed into gates.
* Gatemages can peer into other gatemages hearthoards through gates, and greater gatemages can actually steal the hearthoards of lesser gatemages.
* The Greek girls' name is Yilka, but her secret name that her parents gave her after picking up on more and more hints that she might be a gatemage is Hermia.
