### Summary
Danny finally has a true conversation with Stone, who turns out to be an Orphan - a person with Westilian blood who has only a bastard's relation to one of the actual families. Stone recognizes that Danny is a gatemage. Turns out that Stone is a recruiter for mages - he grows Westilian flowers that draw mages in so he can find them, learns about them as they stick around his house, and potentially offers to find someone who can teach them more about magery. This is what he offers to Danny - to help him find a teacher.

Danny finally exercises some caution and questions Stone a bit, but is happy to have a teacher to look forward to. Turns out that Ced is also a mage - a windmage. Lana has no powers though.
