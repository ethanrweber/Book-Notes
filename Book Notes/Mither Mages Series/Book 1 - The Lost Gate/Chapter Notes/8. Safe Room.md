### Summary
Danny and Eric are scoping out houses to rob - turns out that the ones they're looking at are embassies on Embassy Row, and the cops pull up to talk to them. Danny lies that they're on their way home from music lessons, and "proves" it by singing to the cops which is convincing enough that they leave.

They go further on and find non-embassy houses to rob. They pick a big one and Danny gates in and begins looking for valuables. He finds a secret trap door under a rug and a family tied up in the basement, the father already dead through a gunshot wound. This house has already been robbed! He leaves immediately, tells Eric what happened, gates far away to a church or somewhere and calls 911 to report what he saw, then hangs up.

He meets up with Eric again. Eric is angry about Danny calling the police, but Danny refuses to apologize. He gates back to Stone's house and makes a sandwich, but he's a bit nauseous from the day's events and sets down the sandwich.
