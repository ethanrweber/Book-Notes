### Summary
Danny arrives on Leslie and Marion's farm. They hide the fact that they know about magery at first, but Danny coaxes it out of them by flaunting his own gatemagery. They talk about whether they can trust him, what magery is, what outselves are, how he can be trained, the Gate Thief, and how what Danny as a gatemage loves and serves to gain power is spacetime itself. 

Leslie and Marion agree to take him in and train him, but all three of them recognize it will be along the lines of the blind leading the blind due to their differences in power and ability innate to their mage types.

Danny spends about a year trying to discover how to close his gates and pull back the pieces of his outself, but doesn't make any progress. But at least life is better here than it was in the family compound.
