### Summary
Danny and the Silvermans discuss Danny's upcoming birthday (even though it's a few months away). They're going to get him a car, but they discuss why he does or doesn't need a car because of his peculiar life. 

Danny doesn't really care for a car, but he does want to go to high school. He wants to go to Parry McCluer High School in Buena Vista, about 20 miles from the North's family compound.

He goes to Stone to talk about getting a birth certificate, where it's revealed that Stone is actually Peter Von Roth - Veevee's wife. Stone helps him get set up. He gets a birth certificate, social security number, immunizations, etc. He's finally ready for high school.
