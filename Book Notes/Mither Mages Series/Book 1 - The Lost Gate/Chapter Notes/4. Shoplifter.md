### Summary
Danny, wearing his country bumpkin outfit and lacking shoes, silvertongues his way past a security guard and into a walmart. After a short learning experience of how to not look like a shoplifter and evade the loss prevention guys, he gathers a bunch of stuff into a cart and opens a gate to teleport his way out of the store with his shoplifted goods. He also learns while he's there that humans are complex, unlike he's been told through his family. Danny also learns that he's really good at persuasion, similar to Loki, further proving to himself that he's a de facto gatemage.

After walmart, he walks into town wearing his new clothes - with the tags still on them. Danny runs into some teenage boys behind a local store, and they take the tags off for him. They argue and discuss things a bit more, and one of the boys, Eric, resolves to leave this town and join Danny. Eric promises to teach Danny how to beg (and survive in the regular world) while Danny will teach Eric how to persuade people and become a good shoplifter. Then they hop in a truck together and leave town, headed north towards D.C.
