### Summary
Wad hears of a rumor that Anonoei is plotting to kill Queen Bexoi. He discusses the rumor with Hull in the shade garden; Hull is angry because someone tried to poison the Queen with a glass of tea that Hull was to deliver. They part ways after the discussion, and soon after, Hull is murdered in silence. Wad discovers this and immediately suspects Anonoei further of her intent to kill the Queen, as she would've known that Hull suspected her after Hull caught the person who tried to poison the tea.

Wad gates Anonoei and her boys, Eluik and Enopp, into a makeshift prison, in an area near the castle that could function in such a way due to how the castle was constructed. He tells Bexoi of this and she asks why he doesn't simply kill them. He doesn't want to be a murderer.
