### Summary
Veevee and Danny experiment with some hypotheses on how gates work and what you can and can't do with them. They discover that gates can be "eaten" or "swallowed" by another gate, and hypothesize that the Carthaginian god, Bel, was actually the one who ate all the Great Gates, and Loki was the one who was blamed after Bel stole his outself. Following that hypothesis, they continued with how maybe Bel is also the Gate Thief, stealing the outself of anyone who dares make a Great Gate.
