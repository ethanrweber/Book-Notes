### Summary
Danny has his first day of high school. A girl named Laurette shows him around the school, but she's a little stuck up, so Danny takes the opportunity to show off his quick wit which will either make her a friend or an enemy. All he wants is to be known, and he'll get it for sure this way.

At lunch he says Laurette and some of her friends sitting together. He joins them, pokes some fun at them, and pushes the fat goth girl through a super-thin gate which heals her piercings and closes the holes.

Coach Lieder noticed him running in the morning, and tries to force him to run again. Danny doesn't like being timed though (and doesn't want to show off his powers of course), so he doesn't give Lieder the satisfaction of doing so.

During gym, he stupidly makes a gate up the rope climb to help a kid get to the top. The kid disappears about a mile up in the sky though before coming back down the rope. More kids hop on and the same happens, and then the gates start closing themselves. Danny assumes that Veevee was helping him out of this idiotic situation he made and runs outside, only to find the Greek girl from [[2. The Greek Girl]]. He immediately gates away.
